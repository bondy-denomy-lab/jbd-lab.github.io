description: "Daphne graduated from UCLA with a degree in Biophysics. As an undergraduate, she studied the effects of chaotropes and kosmotropes on protein hydration layers under the guidance of [Dr. Giovanni Zocchi](https://zocchi.physics.ucla.edu). She discovered her interest in structural biology when she spent a summer working under [Dr. Kliment Verba](https://verbalab.ucsf.edu) at UCSF. As a graduate student, Daphne is characterizing anti-CRISPR proteins in collaboration with the [Fraser Lab](https://fraserlab.com/), as well as pursuing structural biology projects related to the phage-bacteria arms race. Outside of lab, Daphne enjoys birding, reading, and playing with her cat [Lilly](/pets/#Lilly). Daphne is supported by a graduate fellowship from the [UCSF Discovery Fellows Program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/discovery-fellows-program)."
