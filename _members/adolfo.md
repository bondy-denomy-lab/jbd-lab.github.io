description: "Adolfo Cuesta is an Infectious Disease Fellow who joined the Bondy-Denomy lab in July 2024. He completed undergraduate training at Haverford College and then worked with Dr. Dan Littman at NYU studying Th17 cell regulation. He then migrated to the west coast to start in the UCSF MSTP. In 2019, he completed a PhD in Chemistry and Chemical Biology with Dr. Jack Taunton where he developed lysine-reactive aryl sulfonyl fluoride-based covalent inhibitors of Hsp90. He then completed his MD in 2021 and stayed at UCSF for Internal Medicine residency and Infectious Disease fellowship. He is excited about phage engineering and exploring the use of bacteriophage therapy to treat highly antibiotic resistant infections."
