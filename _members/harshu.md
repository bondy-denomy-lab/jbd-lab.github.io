description: “Harshu Musunuri is an MD-PhD student in the biophysics program and is focused on synthetic bacteriophage engineering. Harshu grew up in Seattle and studied a combination of chemistry and computer science at Stanford, where she graduated from in 2022 with honors. During her undergrad, she worked in [Dr. Peter Kim’s lab](https://peterkimlab.stanford.edu/) at the ChEM-H Institute, designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza. She also spent summers at the [Institute for Protein Design](https://www.bakerlab.org/) and at [D.E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/) studying algorithms for protein design and molecular dynamics simulations. In the Bondy-Denomy lab, she will continue applying protein design to viruses (this time prokaryotic ones!) to enable generalizable retargeting of phage specificity, as well as custom payload delivery. She is excited to understand the molecular underpinnings of phage injection, and apply this towards new kinds of therapeutics for human disease. When she’s not at the bench or on her computer, Harshu loves to read, dance, bike around SF hills, and explore the outdoors.”
