description: “Michelle Grunberg is a Tetrad graduate student and joined the Bondy-Denomy lab in June 2024. She grew up in Los Angeles and graduated with a bachelors in biology from UC Santa Barbara in 2020. In undergrad, she studied a previously uncharacterized small open reading frame of the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus in the lab of [Dr. Carolina Arias](https://labs.mcdb.ucsb.edu/arias/carolina/) and interned at UCSF and the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Biohub](czbiohub.org), where she optimized metagenomic next-generation sequencing by harnessing CRISPR-Cas9 technology. After her bachelors, Michelle developed Cas13-based technologies to study viral and host RNA in the labs of [Drs. Pardis Sabeti]((https://www.sabetilab.org/) and [Cameron Myhrvold](https://myhrvoldlab.com/) at the Broad Institute and Princeton University. Later, she returned to the CZ Biohub, where she developed fluorescent reporters of viral infection in mammalian cell culture. As a graduate student in the Bondy-Denomy lab, she is excited to study novel phage inhibitors of nucleotide signaling immune systems such as Thoeris and CBASS. Outside of the lab, Michelle enjoys exploring the city, painting, reading, and getting out in nature."
