description: "Miaoxi Liu is a Tetrad graduate student who joined the Bondy-Denomy lab in June 2024. Miaoxi grew up in Xi’an, the capital of thirteen dynasties of ancient China. She attended high school in Canada and pursued a bachelor’s degree in Immunology and Cell & Molecular Biology at the University of Toronto. During her undergraduate studies, she joined the Cowen Lab and used high-throughput screening methods to identify cell wall and cell wall organization genes of Candida albicans that are essential for cell growth. She also studied genes essential for Candida albicans pathogenic filamentation in anaerobic conditions. With an interest in immunology, she also worked in the Watts lab, studying the role of inflammatory monocytes in co-stimulating T cells during STING agonist immunotherapy. In the Bondy-Denomy lab, Miaoxi will continue studying immunology and host-pathogen interactions. She is excited to study new bacterial immune systems that could potentially target different families of phages. In her spare time, Miaoxi enjoys making crafts, drawing, and swimming."
