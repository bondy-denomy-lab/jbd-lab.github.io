description: "Esther is a postdoctoral researcher who joined the Bondy-Denomy lab in September 2024. Originally from Israel, she completed her graduate studies at Bar-Ilan University (BIU) in the Ehud Banin Lab, focusing on prophage-host interactions. During her time at BIU, Esther developed a passion for unraveling the complex dynamics between bacteria and phages. In the Bondy-Denomy lab, she is excited to explore bacterial immune system mechanisms and their regulation. Outside of research, Esther is the proud mother of twin boys, balancing her work as a dedicated scientist and parent. She enjoys supporting women in science and cherishing time with her family."
